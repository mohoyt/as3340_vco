# AS3340 Voltage Controlled Oscillator
A Eurorack VCO powered by AS3340

# Features
* 40mm x 99mm single PCB design (so very cheap to manufacture)
* Lots of standing resistors and diodes to help achieve this (so it's a super crowded PCB)
* See BOM info [here](bom/ibom.html)

# Inputs
* 1v/Oct In
* CV2 In
* FM In
* Sync In (selectable between hard and soft sync with switch and settable between positive hard sync (default) and negative hard sync with a jumper)
* PWM Control In

# Outputs
* Sawtooth
* Square
* Triangle

# Influences
* [Digisound 80 VCO](http://www.digisound80.co.uk/digisound/modules/80-2_files/80-2.pdf)
* [Eddy Bergman's 3340 VCO](https://www.eddybergman.com/2020/01/synthesizer-build-part-18-really-good.html)
* [AI Synthesis' VCO](https://aisynthesis.com/product/ai011-voltage-controlled-oscillator/)

# Status
* Awaiting first batch of PCBs. Not tested yet. Use this design at your own risk. 
* Lots of standing resistors to maximise 
* No panel yet
